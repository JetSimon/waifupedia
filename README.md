to install the bot on your server you will need your own bot token for now. You will also need a .env in the directory the waifupedia.py file is in. This .env files should follow the format:

# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOURTOKEN
DISCORD_GUILD=example guild name

Then you just run the waifupedia.py file from your command line, sit back, and let the waifus roll in.

Once you have the bot in your server you can run %help to see a list of commands.
